HR Data Source
---
This data was  downloaded as an CSV file. The data contained document and information about a companyemployee,stating each employee businesstravel,age band,department,gender, educational field, job role,Attrition, marital starus etc....

Calculations from this data
---
1. Total number of current employee =(Total number of employee - Total number of Attrition)
2. Attrition rate = (sum of attrition  count / sum of employee count)

What is Attrition
---
Attrition refers to a gradual reduction in the number of employees in a company due to various factors like resignations, retirements, or even deaths, without the company necessarily filling these vacancies. In a business context, attrition is often measured as a percentage and is an indicator of workforce stability.

- Total employee was gotten from employee count
- Total number of current employee =(Total number of employee - Total number of Attrition), which was displayed using card visual tool
- Average age was also gotten from CF-age band column, which was made possible by the use of measure
-  Attrition rate = (sum of attrition  count / sum of employee count) 16%
-  Doughnut chat showing the attrition count by department
-  Bar chart to visualise the count of attrition count by educational field
-  Pie chart shows the amount of attrition by gender

Facts From HR Data
---
1. R$D  Department has the highest level of attrition count 133(56.12%),HR Department has the least attrition count 12(38.06%)
2. life science field has the highest amount of attrition 89 followed by medical field 63, while Human resources field has 7 attriton count, why?
3. Male gender has an attrition count of 150(63.29%), female has 87(36.71%)

- WE noticed that the rate of attrition of employee in the life science and medical educational field are on the high side, which is due to the nature of their field it require constant development

Advise
---
the company should create a car   development plan for it employees, so they can improve the employee retention rate. Employees get to improve in their educational field and then work at the same time
