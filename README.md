# LITA-CLASS-DOCUMENTATION
Where i documented my milestone during my data analysis training at LITA Africa

### Project Title: Incubator Hub Milestone

### Project Overview
---
This involves finding solutions to data problems using data analytical tools, thereby creating insights and business strategies. The purpose of data analysis is to understand, interpret and present data adequeately for easy call to action

### Data Source
---
The primary Source of data are CSV files downloaded from open source kaggle  or other repository site

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Visualization
- SQL - structured Query Language
  1. For querying data
- Github
  1. For portfolio building

### Data cleaning and Preperations
---
We perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing varibles
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratoy Data Analysis

# LITA_ POWER BI _DOCUMENTATION

BI Class Preview
---
We went through data entry, Data cleaning using a columinal data. practise Power BI using an HR data

HR Data Source
---
This data was  downloaded as an CSV file. The data contained document and information about a companyemployee,stating each employee businesstravel,age band,department,gender, educational field, job role,Attrition, marital starus etc....

Steps in visualizing the HR data
---
- Downloaded the data
- Cleaned the data
- Changed types
- Promoted header
- Added conditional column
- Renamed column

Calculations from this data
---
1. Total number of current employee =(Total number of employee - Total number of Attrition)
2. Attrition rate = (sum of attrition  count / sum of employee count)

What is Attrition
---
Attrition refers to a gradual reduction in the number of employees in a company due to various factors like resignations, retirements, or even deaths, without the company necessarily filling these vacancies. In a business context, attrition is often measured as a percentage and is an indicator of workforce stability.

- Total employee was gotten from employee count
- Total number of current employee =(Total number of employee - Total number of Attrition), which was displayed using card visual tool
- Average age was also gotten from CF-age band column, which was made possible by the use of measure
-  Attrition rate = (sum of attrition  count / sum of employee count) 16%
-  Doughnut chat showing the attrition count by department
-  Bar chart to visualise the count of attrition count by educational field
-  Pie chart shows the amount of attrition by gender

Facts From HR Data
---
1. R$D  Department has the highest level of attrition count 133(56.12%),HR Department has the least attrition count 12(38.06%)
2. life science field has the highest amount of attrition 89 followed by medical field 63, while Human resources field has 7 attriton count, why?
3. Male gender has an attrition count of 150(63.29%), female has 87(36.71%)

- WE noticed that the rate of attrition of employee in the life science and medical educational field are on the high side, which is due to the nature of their field it require constant development

Advise
---
the company should create a car   development plan for it employees, so they can improve the employee retention rate. Employees get to improve in their educational field and then work at the same time


#LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION
---
I documented my final project here, where i worked on a sale data and customer data set through the series of excel, sql then power Bi. Data set link is down below for your personal use
These data contain two data set for:
1. sales data- which show the selling purchase of different product at different regions
2. Customer data- Which customer behaviour to TV Subscription over a certain period of time
[Download here]_https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12yT7pnZz6-XUSfskManIIpcUO7EBY82i?rtpof=true&usp=drive_fs

Steps taken in excel
---
- Loaded the data
- Cleanedbthe data
- Removed duplicate
- Created pivot table for different visualisation needs
- create report

Pivot Tables for Each Data set

Sale data

Calculations in Both data set
---
- Total sale = Quantity * Unit price
- Average Total sale = Total sale / Product Quantity
- Overall Quantity = SUM(F2:F9922)
- Overall Total Sales= sum of total sale in each rigion
- Average sale per product = overall total sales / Total quantity
